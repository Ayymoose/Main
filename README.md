# Main
Contains all my individual work so far

I am an undergraduate at Imperial College London currently enrolled in BSc Computing (3-years).
My repository contains all my work that I consider worthy of keeping.
Also implementations that are useful for certain talks such as Project Euler problems (See the folder).
